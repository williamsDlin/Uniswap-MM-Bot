python bot_b_rl.py

# Terminal 3
python bot_d_gas.py
```

## 📊 Evaluation & Comparison

### Performance Metrics

Each bot is evaluated on:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Strategy Decisions** | Number of rebalances, parameter adaptations |
| 💰 **LP Fees Earned** | Total fees collected from Uniswap |
| ⛽️ **Gas Cost** | Total gas expenditure across all transactions |
| 📈 **ROI** | Net return = (fees - gas cost) / capital |
| 🕰️ **Downtime** | Hours with no active position |
| 🔁 **Position Effectiveness** | % of time price was within active range |
| 🧪 **Adaptivity Score** | How well bot adjusted to market changes |

### Running Evaluation

```python
from evaluation.evaluator import BotEvaluator

evaluator = BotEvaluator(evaluation_period_hours=168)  # 7 days

# Load bot performance data
evaluator.load_bot_data("bot_a", "bot_a_adaptive_actions_*.csv", "adaptive_bollinger")
evaluator.load_bot_data("bot_b", "bot_b_rl_actions_*.csv", "rl_rebalancer") 
evaluator.load_bot_data("bot_d", "bot_d_gas_aware_actions_*.csv", "gas_aware")

# Generate comparison
results = evaluator.compare_all_bots()
evaluator.save_results("evaluation_results.json")
evaluator.create_leaderboard_json("leaderboard.json")

- State includes learned parameters, experience, and performance history
- Graceful shutdown saves final model state

### Model Loading

- Incremental learning continues from saved state
- No training restart required

## 🎛️ Configuration

### ML-Specific Settings
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash

MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=50
GAS_SAVINGS_THRESHOLD=0.15
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Models not loading:**

- Verify model file permissions
- Check log files for detailed error messages

**Poor performance:**
- Allow sufficient learning time (>50 cycles)
- Verify market data quality
